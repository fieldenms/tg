/**
 * Interface for TG Web API.
 * This is intended to provide generic application quering capability to easily integrate domain knowledge in the inside or outside of the application.
 * <p>
 * Several layers of Web API is to be supported:
 *  1. internal server-side API (this interface);
 *  2. web API resource (to be able to integrate from external applications by means of HTTP requests) -- at '/api';
 *  3. web application UI for executing / validating queries -- at '/resources/api/graphiql.html'.
 * <p>
 * Please note that quering can support 'active' / 'memory' functions and not only 'informative' (as per "Conceptual Modeling of Information Systems" by Antoni Oliv√©).
