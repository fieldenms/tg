/**
 * Annotation for defining properties that should not be changed once they attain their value (i.e., such properties become immutable).
 * The modus operandi of this annotation is controlled by attributes {@code persistedOnly} and {@code nullIsValueForPersisted}.
 * <p>
 * Attribute {@code persistedOnly} controls when the final semantics are enforced â€“ before or after an entity was persisted.
 * By default the final semantics is enforced only after an entity was persisted (value {@code true}).
 * Otherwise, the final semantics are enforced immediately after assigning a non-{@ code null} value to a property.
 * <p>
 * The default semantics treats {@code null} as not a value.
 * This means that by default immutability is only enforced for properties that have a non-{@code null} value.
 * However, if {@code persistedOnly} is {@code true}, this semantics can be changed in application to persisted entities by setting attribute {@code nullIsValueForPersisted} to {@code true}.
