/**
 * A configuration of an entity related action, which is associated with every entity that is represented by an entity centre.
 * <p>
 * These actions should be nameless as there would several instances of the same action as part of a single entity centre -- one for each retrieved entity.
 * However, it would still be potentially desirable to disable other entity actions if one of them has been activated and is still in progress.
 * For this, an entity specific and local to the entity centre message channel should be created with ability for all associated actions to publish
 * and subscribe to generic messages, designed specifically to coordinate their group state.
