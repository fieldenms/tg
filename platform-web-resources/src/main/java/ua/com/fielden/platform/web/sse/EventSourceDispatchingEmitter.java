/**
 * {@link IEventSourceEmitter} implementation that acts as a dispatching emitter, which dispatches events to registered emitters.
 * Every emitter is added on a request from a web client (every client makes such request), and is associated with a specific user and a unique identifier.
 * There can potentially be multiple emitters for the same user. For example, a user who loads an application in 2 browser tabs would have 2 separate emitters associated with that user.
 * <p>
 * At this stage dispatching happens by means of broadcasting every event to all emitters.
 * However, in the future, it is planned to support sending events to emitters, associated with specific users.
 * <p>
 * Another important role for this class, is to instantiate and register event sources that are specified at the level of Entity Centre configurations.
 * All such event sources get connected to an instance of this class, which ensures that any emitter registered with this class will have events from all the event sources dispatched to them.
 * <p>
 * By design, there should be only a single instance of this class per application – one dispatching emitter per application.
